Their presence not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the architecture but also serves as a reminder of Thailand's rich history and spiritual heritage.", "The tiered roof style serves both practical and symbolic purposes, providing ventilation and protection from the elements while also symbolizing prosperity and spiritual significance. This architectural tradition can be observed in various structures across Thailand, including temples, palaces, and traditional Thai houses, showcasing the country's rich cultural heritage and artistic craftsmanship.", "Indented corners represent a characteristic aspect of traditional Thai architecture, where the corners of a rectangular building are divided into multiple recessed sections."],
